# CardioTF_Database
user can visit cardioTF database at http://www.cardiosignal.org/database/cardiotf.html. These scripts published here were 
used to biocurate the data and do text analysis to define the core cardiac factors. Raw data and intermediary files can be 
downloaded at http://www.cardiosignal.org/download/download.html. The scripts and raw data can be used to confirm my findings
in my recent work (submitted)
